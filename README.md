# TaskManager
Simple To Do list, without bloat.

I don't want an all in one complicated app like Microsoft To Do, or Trello. 
I want a simple hammer in the world of swiss army knives.

Simply login and add projects and tasks - no customization, no fancy canban tables, no agile workflows, no bullshit.
